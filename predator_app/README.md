## Troubleshooting

### Module Not Detected
- **Check physical connections** - Ensure proper pin alignment
- **Verify power switches** - GPS switch must be DOWN before connecting
- **Confirm GPIO configuration** - Check Momentum settings for correct pins
- **Try board reselection** - Settings > Board Selection

### GPS Not Acquiring Satellites
- **Clear sky required** - GPS needs unobstructed view of sky
- **Wait time** - Initial acquisition can take 30-90 seconds
- **Check antenna** - Ensure GPS antenna is connected
- **Indoor limitation** - GPS typically doesn't work indoors

### ESP32 Not Responding
- **Reboot Flipper** - Power cycle the device
- **Check UART pins** - Verify pins 15,16 are configured
- **Marauder firmware** - Ensure ESP32 has Marauder firmware installed
- **Try different commands** - Test with simple status command first

### Memory Issues
- **Close other apps** - Exit all running applications
- **Restart device** - Full reboot clears memory
- **Reduce features** - Some scenes disabled for memory optimization

### Build Errors
- **Update ufbt**: `pip install --upgrade ufbt`
- **Update SDK**: `ufbt update`
- **Clean build**: `ufbt clean && ufbt`
- **Check firmware version** - Ensure Momentum dev branch
