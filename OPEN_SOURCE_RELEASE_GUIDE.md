## 🎯 **OPEN SOURCE OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Keep EASRL (Recommended for Security Tools)** ✅

**Current License: EASRL (Educational and Authorized Security Research License)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Perfect for security research tools
- ✅ Prevents malicious use
- ✅ Protects you from liability
- ✅ Requires authorization
- ✅ Allows contributions
- ✅ Allows modifications for authorized use
- ✅ Maintains ethical standards

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Not "OSI-approved open source"
- ⚠️ Cannot redistribute commercially without permission
- ⚠️ More restrictive than MIT/Apache

**Best For:**
- Security research tools
- Tools that could be misused
- Professional/enterprise tools
- Legal protection priority

**Recommendation**: **KEEP EASRL** - It's ideal for your use case!

---

### **Option 2: Switch to Permissive License** (Optional)

If you want traditional "open source":

#### **MIT License**
- ✅ Very permissive
- ✅ OSI-approved
- ✅ Commercial use allowed
- ⚠️ Less protection from misuse
- ⚠️ No authorization requirement
- ⚠️ Less liability protection

#### **Apache 2.0**
- ✅ Permissive with patent grant
- ✅ OSI-approved
- ✅ Good for enterprise
- ⚠️ Less control over misuse
- ⚠️ Requires more user responsibility

#### **GPLv3**
- ✅ Copyleft (derivatives must be open)
- ✅ OSI-approved
- ✅ Prevents proprietary forks
- ⚠️ Complex compliance
- ⚠️ Can limit commercial adoption

**Recommendation**: **STAY WITH EASRL** unless you have specific reasons to change!
