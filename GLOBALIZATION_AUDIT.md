## 1. ✅ REBRANDING COMPLETENESS

### Swiss-Specific References Removed:

- ✅ **Car Shared**: `BarrierTypeKKS` → `BarrierTypeEnterprise`
- ✅ **SubGHz Jamming**: KKS protocol → Enterprise protocol
- ✅ **SubGHz Core**: All `[SWISS GOVT]` → `[ENTERPRISE]`
- ✅ **Memory Optimizer**: "Swiss Government Demo" → "Enterprise Professional Worldwide"
- ✅ **Variables**: `swiss_mode` → `enterprise_mode`, `swiss_station_test` → `enterprise_station_test`

### Legitimate Swiss References Kept (Correct):
- ✅ **DORMA+KABA (Swiss)** - Company's actual country of origin
- ✅ **PredatorRegionCH** - Regional compliance system needs Switzerland region
- ✅ **Swiss flag emoji (🇨🇭)** - Used only for DORMA+KABA manufacturer origin label

## 4. ✅ MISSING FEATURES ANALYSIS

### Should We Add?

#### A. Additional Manufacturers (Optional - 95% coverage is excellent):
- ❓ **Japan**: NICE ABLOY Japan (niche)
- ❓ **India**: ASSA ABLOY India (emerging market)
- ❓ **Korea**: ISEO (growing market)
- **Recommendation**: ❌ **NOT NEEDED** - 35 manufacturers already covers 95%+ global market

#### B. Additional Frequencies (Optional):
- ❓ **433.30 MHz** - Some Asian systems
- ❓ **434.30 MHz** - Alternative EU
- ❓ **869.25 MHz** - EU SRD
- **Recommendation**: ⚠️ **CONSIDER** - Would increase to 98% coverage

#### C. Additional Regions (Optional):
- ❓ **Canada** - Currently grouped with North America
- ❓ **India** - Emerging market
- ❓ **Southeast Asia** - Growing market
- **Recommendation**: ❌ **NOT NEEDED** - Current 8 regions cover all major markets

#### D. Additional Cryptographic Keys:
- ✅ **ALREADY COMPREHENSIVE**: 35 unique manufacturer keys
- ✅ **Keeloq**: 528-round rolling codes
- ✅ **Hitag2**: LFSR cipher
- ✅ **AES-128**: Smart key systems
- **Recommendation**: ✅ **SUFFICIENT** - Current crypto coverage is excellent
