## üîí **Security Considerations**

### **Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Email: security@predator-security.com (if available)
2. Provide detailed description
3. Include proof of concept (if safe to share)
4. Wait for response before public disclosure

### **Responsible Disclosure:**
- Give maintainers reasonable time to fix (90 days recommended)
- Coordinate disclosure timeline
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Document impact and severity

---

## üåç **Adding Worldwide Support**

### **New Manufacturers:**

When adding barrier/car manufacturers:

```c
// 1. Add to enum in proper regional group
typedef enum {
    // ... existing ...
    BarrierManufacturerYourNew,  // YourManufacturer (Country)
} BarrierManufacturer;

// 2. Add cryptographic key (from legitimate research)
static const uint64_t barrier_manufacturer_keys[] = {
    // ... existing ...
    0xYOURKEYHERE123456,  // YourManufacturer - researched key
};

// 3. Add display name
static const char* barrier_manufacturer_names[] = {
    // ... existing ...
    "YourManufacturer (Country)",
};
```

**Requirements:**
- Keys must be from legitimate security research
- Include country/region
- Document source of key data
- Ensure legal to publish

### **New Frequencies:**

When adding frequencies:

```c
// Add to predator_frequencies.h with proper documentation
433123000,  // 433.123 MHz - Description (Region/Standard)
```

**Requirements:**
- Document regulatory region (FCC/ETSI/ARIB/etc.)
- Note legal restrictions
- Verify frequency is legitimate
- Include use case

---

## üìö **Documentation Guidelines**

### **Code Comments:**

```c
// GOOD:
// Initialize Keeloq engine for worldwide barrier manufacturers
// Uses 64-bit manufacturer-specific keys with 528-round encryption
bool init_keeloq_engine(uint64_t mfr_key) {
    // ...
}

// BAD:
// init keeloq
bool init_keeloq_engine(uint64_t k) {
    // ...
}
```

### **README Updates:**

- Keep legal disclaimers prominent
- Document new features clearly
- Include usage examples
- Note any breaking changes
- Update feature counts (manufacturers, frequencies, etc.)
